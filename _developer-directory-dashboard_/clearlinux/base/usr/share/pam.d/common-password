# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.

# See the pam_unix manpage for options.

password	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite			pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required			pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
